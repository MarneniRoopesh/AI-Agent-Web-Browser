# AI-Agent-Web-Browser
üñ•Ô∏è Run AI Agent in your browser.

This project builds upon the foundation of the browser-use, which is designed to make websites accessible for AI agents.

Features :

WebUI: is built on Gradio and supports most of browser-use functionalities. This UI is designed to be user-friendly and enables easy interaction with the browser agent.

Expanded LLM Support: We've integrated support for various Large Language Models (LLMs), including: Google, OpenAI, Azure OpenAI, Anthropic, DeepSeek, Ollama etc. And we plan to add support for even more models in the future.

Custom Browser Support: You can use your own browser with our tool, eliminating the need to re-login to sites or deal with other authentication challenges. This feature also supports high-definition screen recording.

Persistent Browser Sessions: You can choose to keep the browser window open between AI tasks, allowing you to see the complete history and state of AI interactions.
